# Catitude Cat Psychologist
An online website for a cat psychologist trying to help users find solutions to common problems or make a booking to come into the clinic.

## Getting Started

### What is this
This was the first website I built when I started Information Technology at UQ. Along the way I learned a few new concepts and tried to improve it to be more meaningful and reflect what we were required to build. I have incorporated some of the css grid styles I learnt to improve the layouts.

### Goals and Requirements
This page was meant to reflect a fictional characters cat psychology business and be influenced by cat themes. It needed to have typical web business pages and allow for users to make contact with the owner. The site also had to suggest solutions to some common 'catty' problems.
