				<h3>Jackson Supernova</h3>

				<p>
					A cat behaviorist with more than fifteen years of experience, Jackson Supernova specializes in helping individuals whose “out of control” cats are turning their lives and homes upside down.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jackson Supernova has conducted behavior studies of feline and animal behavior for 20 years, with the most recent study occurring at the prestigious University of Queensland.  He travels worldwide to lecture on cat behavior and was recently in Toronto as the keynote speaker for the Humane Society and SPCA at the Canada Behavior Convention 2014. In addition to working with the Animal Welfare League internationally, Supernova has authored a scholarly cited and science-based cat behavior book (Random House Publishing) with the latest strategies to help cats — as opposed to other cat behavior books filled with obsolete and incomplete advice you can easily find on the internet.

				<p>
					At Catitude Clinic we have a licensed veterinarian and an IAABC associate certified cat behaviorist. Both professionals take the time to practice responsible and ethical behavior care for cats. We offer regular and drop-in consultation appointments to provide you and your cat(s) an effective and all-encompassing behavior plan. Dedicated to the study of cat behavior, Catitude conducts behavior studies as part of many of our behavior consultations. This invaluable information benefits not only the consulting cat and owner but also the lives of cats everywhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many people will tell you that it’s impossible to train or otherwise change the behavior of a cat. Over the last two decades our behaviorists have successfully applied a method consisting of compassionate awareness and a three-part behavior modification to help resolve the unwanted behaviors of thousands of cats. We are here to show cat lovers that cats’ behavior can be reliably and consistently changed for the better. We will show you exactly how to use the uniquely effective three-stage method to solve every one of the fourteen major cat behavior problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Philosophy: Cats are not like dogs. They are also not like humans. All cat behavior consulting has to start with this awareness. That is because nearly all failed efforts to modify cats’ behavior assume that cat psychology is like dog psychology or, worse, like human psychology. These efforts are doomed to fail because they are based on ignorance of the uniqueness of individual cats and instinctual colony behavior dynamics. Cat behavior specialist Jackson Supernova is here to help you.
