					<h5>Luna</h5>

					<p>
						Luna came into Catitude as quite an aggressive, yet shy little kitten. Around her owners she’s pretty confident and often displays anti-social behavior such as clawing and biting regularly as well as making loud vocal complaints when she’s picked up. When new people visit the household, however, she’s runs and finds a hiding spot quicker than she runs to her food bowl at meal time. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We are working on fixing her shyness and getting her to be more confident and open around strangers. This kind of therapy involves having her in controlled environments where we introduce her to new people every week. Luckily we have enough volunteers to keep each session fresh and new!
					</p>
					<p>
						Luna’s favorite treat is roast chicken and she could devour an entire chicken without hesitation. She’s a bit of a diva and will refuse to eat any meat that isn’t cooked, with the exception of fish. Her owners complain she’s getting a little fat but we can assure you that she’s in a healthy weight for a cat of her age.

					<h5 id="catitudeheading">Miu Miu</h5>
					<p>
						Miu Miu is one of the more friendly cats we have coming through Catitude. He loves to wander around and put himself on display. He adores all of the attention that everyone at the clinic is more than happy to give him. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Miu Miu came to us with a bit of an eating problem… he loves to eat! You put anything down near him and hell gobble it up like a vacuum cleaner. Having an eating addiction isn’t always an easy process to fix. He is a smart cat and knows when you’re not feeding him enough food! The trick to this is giving him specially formulated cat food as well as introducing more frequent feeding but with less food per session. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We haven’t quite figured out what his favorite treat is as anything put in his food bowl is consumed with the same gusto and enthusiasm.
